## Welcome to the Cognitive Services

In this tutorial I am  going to integrate two of the cognitive services that I have created through Azure Machine Learning  course. First, I will create a Custom Vision Service that train a model for identifying objects. Second, I will integrate  a chat bot service  with the custom vision service that will automatically respond to our users depending on what they are asking. Finally, these services can be connected to other channels such as Microsoft Teams or Skype Messenger.

### 1. Custom Vision Service
We create new custom vision service using Azure subscription. My location is still going to be set to south central US. Im going to keep using my existing research group and I am going to create was a service has been deployed.
